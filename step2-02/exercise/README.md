# Step 2.2: UI Fabric Component Library (Exercise)

[Lessons](../../) | [Demo](../demo/)

# Exercise 1: Getting familiar with the Fabric documentation site:

Open the [documentation for DefaultButton](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/#/components/button). Use the sidebar to explore other available components.

# Exercise 2: "Fabric"ize the TodoFooter.tsx

If you don't already have the app running, start it by running `npm start` from the root of the `frontend-bootcamp` folder. Click the "exercise" link under day 2 step 2 to see results.

1. Open TSX file inside `exercise/src/components/TodoFooter.tsx`
2. Follow the top TODO comment to import Stack, Text and DefaultButton components from Fabric
3. Follow the TODO comment to:

- replace `<footer>` with a `<Stack>`
- replace `<span>` with a `<Text>`
- replace `<button>` with a `<DefaultButton>`

## Bonus Exercise

GO WILD! There are so many components in the Fabric library! Try to put some components in the exercise component files. Try out these concepts mentioned earlier:

- Importing components from `office-ui-fabric-react`
- Customizing component with props found on the documentation site
- Customize component with render props (these will be called onRender\_\_\_ or similar)
