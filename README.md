# Frontend Bootcamp / Days in the Web

> 🚨🚨 This project is still a WIP. Issues and PRs are welcome for typos or inaccuracies. 🚨🚨

## Purpose of this workshop

This repo is the content for a two-day workshop focused on introducing you to the fundamentals of web development. By the end of these two days you will have a better understanding of how we write and deliver features on the web. You will also get some hands-on experience using everything from HTML, CSS and JavaScript to React, Redux and UI Fabric as we build a working application together.

## Who this workshop is for

This workshop starts as a very high level introduction to the core principles of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This section is targeted at new and experienced developers alike. The second day dives into more complex topics such as TypeScript and state management within an application. The examples should be accessible to anyone, but you will get more out of the day if you have some foundational experience in programing or web technologies.
