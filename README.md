# Frontend Bootcamp / Days in the Web

> ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ This project is a work in progress! Issues and pull requests are encouraged. ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

## Welcome

In this two-day workshop you'll learn the basics of frontend development while building a working web app.

The first day provides an introduction to the fundamentals of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is targeted at new and experienced developers alike. On the second day we'll dive into more advanced topics like TypeScript, testing, and state management. While the examples should be accessible to anyone, you'll get the most out of it if you have some prior experience with programming and web technologies.

## Getting set up

### 1. Required software

Before starting, make sure your computer has up-to-date versions of the following installed:

- [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) (choose the **LTS** option, which should be version 10)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - If using a Mac, also follow [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) to install the `code` terminal command.
  - If you already had VS Code installed, check for updates!
- React Developer Tools for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

### 2. Installing and opening the project

- Open VS Code and then press `ctrl + ~` to open the built in terminal
- Use the `cd` (change directory) command to find an appropriate place for your code 
- Type `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/frontend-bootcamp.git` into the terminal, this will pull down a copy of the workshop code
- Type `cd frontend-bootcamp` to change your current directory to the bootcamp folder
- Type `npm install` to install of the project dependencies
- Type `code ./` to open the bootcamp code in VS Code
> If on a Mac, be sure you've followed [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) first to make the `code` command available.

### 3. Run the "inner loop" build

Now that we have VS Code open with the bootcamp code, open the terminal again `ctrl + ~` and your project should look like this

To run the dev "inner loop" for the first 3 lessons type:
```
npm run static
```

When we get to lesson 4, and React we will stop the static inner loop and start:
1. press `ctrl + c` to stop the static inner loop

```
npm run start
```

Both of these above commands will load the following site:
