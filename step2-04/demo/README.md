# Step 2.4 - React Context (Demo)

[Lessons](../) | [Exercise](./exercise/) | [Demo](./demo/)

In this step, we describe some problems we encounter when creating a more complex application.

We will solve these problems with the React Context API. The Context API consists of Provider and Consumer components. Let's take a look at what is in this step:

1. The problem of complex applications
2. React Context API
3. Consuming context from a Class Component
4. Consuming context from a Functional Component

---

## The problem of complex applications

React represents a single component like this:

```
(props) => view;
```

In a real application, these functions are composed. It looks more like this:

![](../../assets/todo-components.png)

1. Data needs to be passed down from component to component via props. Even when some components do not need to know about some data. This is a problem called **props drilling**

2. Shared data can be changed by various actors (user interaction, updates from server), and there is no coordination of these changes

Even in our simple application, we saw this problem. For example, `<TodoList>` has this props interface:

```ts
interface TodoListProps {
  complete: (id: string) => void;
  remove: (id: string) => void;
  todos: Store['todos'];
  filter: FilterTypes;
  edit: (id: string, label: string) => void;
}
```

All of these props are not used, except to be passed down to a child Component, `TodoListItem`:

```js
<TodoListItem todos="{todos}" complete="{complete}" remove="{remove}" edit="{edit}" />
```

## React Context API

Let's solve these problems with the React Context API. Context is React's way to share data from components to their descendant children components without explicitly passing down through props at every level of the tree. In simpler terms, it solves the props drilling issue mentioned above!

React context is created by calling `createContext()` with some initial data. Use the `<TodoContext.Provider>` component to wrap a part of the component tree that should be handed the context.

### Providing context with `<TodoContext.Provider>`

```js
// To create a completed empty context
const TodoContext = React.createContext(undefined);

class TodoApp extends React.Component {
  render() {

    // Pass in some state and function to the provider's value prop
    return (
      <TodoContext.Provider
        value={{
          ...this.state,
          addTodo={this._addTodo},
          setFilter={this._setFilter},
          /* same goes for remove, complete, and clear */
        }}>
        <div>
          <TodoHeader />
          <TodoList />
          <TodoFooter />
        </div>
      </TodoContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

### Consume context from a Class Component

Inside a class-based child component, such as the `<TodoHeader>` component, the value can be accessed from the component's `context` property like this:

```js
class TodoHeader extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Step 1: use the context prop
    return <div>Filter is {this.context.filter}</div>;
  }
}

// Step 2: be sure to set the contextType property of the component class
TodoHeader.contextType = TodoContext;
```

### Consume context from a Functional Component

If you're using the functional component syntax, you can access the context with the `useContext()` hook. Note that `useContext()` requires a recent release of React (16.8):

```js
const TodoFooter = props => {
  const context = useContext(TodoContext);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={context.clear()}>Clear Completed</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

There is another legal syntax for accessing context with the `<TodoContext.Consumer>`, but we'll leave that out as an exercise for you!
