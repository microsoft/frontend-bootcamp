1. Add an unordered list with class `todos` to the main section
2. Add 4 list items with class `todo` inside of that list with the following content
   `<label><input type="checkbox" /> <span class="title"> Todo </span> </label>`
3. Add a span and a button to your footer
4. Span content should be `<i class="remaining">4</i> items left` and button should say `Clear Completed` and have a class of `submit`
5. Go into the CSS file and add `display: flex` to the footer. Also add `flex-grow:1` to the span inside of the footer
